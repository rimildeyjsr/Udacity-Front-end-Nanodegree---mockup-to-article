I have made some basic websites before, hence i was already aware of the required markup to format the page. But I wasn't aware of the subscript tag mostly. It was an easy task, based on my familiarity with html and i didn't face much difficulty. Well, mostly I used the *asking for help* strategy since the rest of the project was fairly easy.
